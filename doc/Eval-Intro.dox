@section Eval_Intro_General Introduction
This _is not_, _can not_, and _does not want_ to be an all-in-one textbook on electron spectroscopy.
There are many good textbooks for that goal. Even, some of them deal with spectral data evaluation
in great details. Unfortunately, however, those chapters are typically case studies,
rather than a systematic introduction of the terms and methodology used in the spectroscopic data evaluation.

The primary goal of this chapter is to provide a context *what* you are doing and *how* you are doing it,
when evaluating spectra by using this tool. During this, however, it is attempted to present and to compare
different methods, their background, naming and technologies used in that context.
Sometimes the controversial interpretations are also discussed, as well as the *best* and *worst* practices.

As the electrons are coming from the atoms, their energy provides valuable
information about its former atomic/molecular/structural/electronic environment, the method
of excitation, the interactions experienced between the atom and the electron spectrometer,
the sample handling and even the artifacts the experimenter makes during the measurements.
