@section Eval_Intro_General Introduction
This _is not_, _can not_ and _does not want_ to be an all-in-one textbook on electron spectroscopy.
There are many good textbooks for that goal. Even, some of them deal with spectral data evaluation
in great details. Unfortunately, however, those chapters are typically case studies,
rather than a systematic introduction of the terms and methodology used in the spectroscopic data evaluation.

The primary goal of this chapter is to provide a context *what* you are doing and *how* you are doing it,
when evaluating spectra by using this tool. During this, however, it is attempted to present and to compare
different methods, their background, naming and technologies used in that context.
Sometimes the controversial interpretations are also discussed, as well as the *best* and *worst* practices.

As the electrons are coming from the atoms, their energy provides valuable
information about its former atomic/molecular/structural/electronic environment, the method
of excitation, the interactions experienced between the atom and the electron spectrometer,
the sample handling and even the artifacts the experimenter makes during the measurements.

Extracting parameters from the data is the *last step* of the experiment. Usually, you cannot correct
for the artifacts and mistakes, done in the previous stages of experimentation. The tool enables you
at least to verify if they are present. Even, you can add on top of those your own artifacts and mistakes
if use not the right tool or not in the right context. Take care: it is <b>only you</b> who knows
what and how to to, this tool only assists you doing in, both the correct and the incorrect way.
Only you (and not the tool) are responsible for producing right data evaluation results.
