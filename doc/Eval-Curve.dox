@section Eval-Curve_Introl Introduction

In scientific research, the typical scenario is to have a theory,
which can derive a parametrized description of the phenomenon in question,
and a measurement which can derive experimental data.
The task is then to find out what parameters shall be used to <b>best</b>
describe the experimental results. As detailed by @cite Minuit:2004,
neither the terminology nor the mathematical algorithm to determine
what <b>best</b> means, is  unique. In the followings, we will use the word
"minimization" for this activity.

In general, it means that a function is derived somehow, which describes the "goodness",
and a mathematical algorithm is applied to to find out the minimum value.
The parameters producing that minimum value are considered as the <b>best</b>
combination.
The task is not easy at all: those functions may show quite extraordinary behavior:
no "smooth" behavior, multiple minimums, out-of range minimum,
non-existing derivatives, etc.

Minuit @cite Minuit:2004 is one of the most widely used packages. It is mathematically well established,
using several minimization algoritms, well tested and well documented; stable and roboust;
it also provides error estimation for the parameters.
It has been reimplemented in 2004 (from FORTRAN to C++) and it can be downloaded
from @cite Minuit2:2004. For the mathematical algoritms, operational details see @cite Minuit:2004.

@cite Minuit:2004 also provides some facilities like limiting the value of the parameters
or fixing them. Its typical use at CERN is looking for a minimum in some well-defined problem,
where all parameters belong to the same phenomenon.

In the spectroscopies, however, different other needs might arise.
Several segregated components appear side-by-side, the components are transformed during their interactions,
certain relations are known from other sources, a paremeter of several components has the same
(but otherwise unknown) value, some parameter depends of the independent variable, etc.
That means that some exterbal information must be feed into the model, and during
the evaluation several such models shall be tested and validated.

To consider a new model, a new theoretical model is necessary. Although in principle
it is possible to prepare several theoretical functions, in practice it is much more desirable
to provide a flexible model, which can be changed 'on the fly'.

@section Eval-Curve_Parameter  Parameter

In Minuit, the parameters are not just a value. MinuitParameter has in additition lower and upper bound,
uncertainty, different flags, string label, format hints, etc. This allows to fix the parameter value
(and so it cannot be changed by the minimization routine), upper and lower bounds (which, if they are active,
the parameter cannot take the values excluded by the bounds.
