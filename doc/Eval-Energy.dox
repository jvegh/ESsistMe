@section Eval-Energy_Intro Introduction

As will be discussed, the energy of the electrons carry a wealth of information
on the originating environment, so the precise interpretation of the structure
they manifest in the experimental spectra and the precise determination
of the energy-related quantitative characteristics is a key question in
all kinds of electron spectroscopies.


@section Eval-Energy_Principle Principle of excitation

Electrons as well as the other components of an atom enjoy their well-deserved rest inside atoms.
Voluntarily, they do not want to leave the atom. The atoms usually need to suffer a collision
before some particle exits the atom.

@subsection Eval-Energy_XPSPrinciple Principle of XPS

In the photoelectron spectroscopy this collision occurs with a primary
X-Ray photon from the environment, see the figure below, from @cite HistoryOfXPS:2012

In the atom, the electrons are in rest and have a so called \f$E_b\f$
binding energy, which must be received during the collision to let the electron
to be free.
As shown, one single photon, which carries energy  \f$h\nu\f$,
can eject an electron from an atomic shell if \f$h\nu>E_b\f$.
The difference (the excess energy) will be the kinetic energy \f$E_k\f$ of the electron,
this energy can be measured in the different electron spectrometers.
A little correction to the energy balance above: there is a little difference
between the Fermi-level and the vacuum level, it is called the *work function* \f$\phi\f$
and the complete energy balance is expressed as

\f$E_b = h\nu - E_k - \phi\f$

\f$E_k = h\nu - E_b - \phi\f$

Using these simple equations, both the kinetic and binding energies can be expressed,
provided the other terms in the equation are known.

These energies represent different sides of the same thing:
as long as the electron is inside the atom, the binding energy is a better tool
to describe its behavior, when with the rest of the energy the electron enters
the electron specrometer, its kinetic energy determines its behavior.

As shown above, one can easily be calculated from the other, and typically both of them
are used during evaluating spectroscopic data.
